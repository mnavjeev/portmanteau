\subsection{Covering Numbers}%
\label{subsec:covering}

Recall that for the covering Donsker Theorem, Theorem~\ref{thm:vdv2.5.2} we require the uniform entropy bound~\eqref{eq:uniform-entropy-bound}:
\[
	\int_{0}^{\infty}  \sup_{Q\in\calQ} \sqrt{\log \calN\left(\eps\|F\|_{Q,2},\calF,L_2(Q)\right)}\;d\eps < \infty
.\] 
where the supremum under the integral is taken over the set of all finitely discrete probability measures \(\calQ\). If we can show that \(\calF\) is such that \(\sup_\calQ \log \calN\left(\eps\|F\|_{Q,2},\calF,L_2(Q)\right) \lesssim \left(\frac{1}{\eps}\right)^{2+\delta}\) for some \(\delta > 0\) then we are fine as this will integrate to a finite number.
