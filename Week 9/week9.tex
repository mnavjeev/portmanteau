\subsection{Covering Numbers}
\label{subsec:covering}

This section roughly covers section 2.6 in Van Der Vaart and Wellner.

Recall that for the covering Donsker Theorem, Theorem~\ref{thm:vdv2.5.2}, we require the uniform entropy bound:
\[
	\int_{0}^{\infty}  \sup_{Q\in\calQ} \sqrt{\log \calN\left(\eps\|F\|_{Q,2},\calF,L_2(Q)\right)}\;d\eps < \infty\tag{UEB}\label{eq:uniform-entropy-bound-2}
.\] 
where the supremum under the integral is taken over the set of all finitely discrete probability measures \(\calQ\). If we can show that \(\calF\) is such that \(\sup_\calQ \log \calN\left(\eps\|F\|_{Q,2},\calF,L_2(Q)\right) \lesssim \left(\frac{1}{\eps}\right)^{2-\delta}\) for some \(\delta > 0\) then we are fine as the square root of this will integrate to a finite number. In fact, we will often be able to verify a much stronger condition, that:
\[
	\sup_\calQ \calN\left(\eps\|F\|_{Q,2},\calF,L_2(Q)\right) \leq K\left(\frac{1}{\eps}\right)^V,\;\;0<\eps<1
.\] 

\subsubsection{VC Classes of Sets}%
\label{subsubsec:vc-class}

A typical way to show that a class of sets \(\calF\) satisfies the \eqref{eq:uniform-entropy-bound} will be to show that it has a limited ``VC-Dimension'', where ``VC'' stands for Vapnick and Cervonenkis. What does this mean?

Let \(\calC\) be a collection of subsets of some set \(\calX\), that is \(\calC \subseteq 2^\calX\). An arbitrary set of points \(\{x_1,\dots,x_n\}\) possesses \(2^n\) subsets.

\begin{definition}[Picking Out]
	\label{def:picks-out}
	Let \(A \subset \{x_1,\dots,x_n\}\). The collection \(\calC\) picks out \(A\) if \(A = C \cap \{x_1,\dots,x_n\}\) for some \(C \in\calC\). We define the number of subsets of \(\{x_1,\dots,x_n\}\) picked out by \(\calC\) as 
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:delta-n}
		\Delta_n(\calC,x_1,\dots,x_n) = \#\left\{C\cap\{x_1,\dots,x_n\}:C\in\calC \right\}	
	\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Shattering]
	\label{def:shattering}
	A collection \(\calC\) shatters \(\{x_1\dots,x_n\}\) if it can pick out all of its \(2^n\) subsets.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[VC Index]
	\label{def:vc-index}
	The VC-Index, \(V(\calC)\) is the smallest \(n\in\SN\) such that \emph{no} set of size \(n\) is shattered by \(\calC\). Equivalently
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:vc-index}
		V(\calC) = \inf\left\{n : \max_{x_1,\dots,x_n} \Delta_n(\calC,x_1,\dots,x_n)<2^n\right\}
	\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[VC Class]
	\label{def:vc-class}
	A collection \(\calC\) of measurable sets is called VC Class if  \(V(\calC)<\infty\). 
\end{definition} 

\begin{remark*}
	Notice that in the Definition of the VC Index, we require that \textit{no} set of size \(n\) is shattered by \(\calC\) rather than requiring that \(n\) be the smallest number such that there exits \textit{any} set of size \(n\) that is not shattered by \(\calC\).
\end{remark*}

\begin{example*}
	\label{ex:vc-indices}
	Suppose \(\calC = \left\{(-\infty,c]:\text{for some }c\in\SR\right\}\). Then any set \(\{x_1\}\) has subsets \(\emptyset\) and \(\{x_1\}.\) For \(\emptyset\) we have that \(\emptyset \subset (-\infty,c]\cap \{x_1\} \) for any \(c < x_1\) while for \(\{x_1\}\) we have that \(\{x_1\}\subseteq (-\infty,c]\cap\{x_1\} \) for any \(c \geq x_1\). Thus we have that \(\calC\) shatters any single element subset of \(\SR\).

	However, take a two element subset \(\{x_1,x_2\}\subset \SR\). Without loss of generality take \(x_1 < x_2\). There are four subsets to consider, \(\emptyset, \{x_1\},\{x_2\},\{x_1,x_2\}\). We can see that there is no set \(C \in \calC\) such that \(C \cap \{x_1,x_2\} = \{x_2\}\), if we take \(C = (\infty,c]\) for some \(c < x_2\) we get that \(C \cap \{x_1,x_2\} = \{x_1\}\) whereas if we take \(C = (-\infty, c]\) for some \(c \geq x_2\) we get that \(C\cap\{x_1,x_2\} = \{x_1,x_2\}\). This exhausts all sets in \(\calC\). 

	Since \(\{x_1,x_2\}\) is arbitrary, we can conclude that the VC Index of \(\calC\) is two, \(V(\calC)=2\).
\end{example*}

\begin{example*}
	\label{ex:vc-indices-2}
	Let \(\calC_1 = \left\{(a,b]:a<b\text{ for } a,b \in \SR\right\}\). Note that this collection is larger than the collection from the prior example. Now however, given a set \(\{x_1,x_2\} \) with \(x_1 < x_2\) we can pick out \(\{x_2\}\) with the set \((x_1,x_2]\in\calC_1\).

	However, now consider a three element subset \(\{x_1,x_2,x_3\}\). Without loss of generality suppose \(x_1 < x_2 < x_3\). We will try to pick out the set \(\{x_1,x_3\}\). Consider any set \(C\in \calC_1\) such that \(\{x_1,x_3\}\subset C \), a necessary condition for \(\{x_1,x_2\} = C \cap \{x_1,x_2,x_3\}\). The set \(C\) is of the form \((a,b]\) for some \(a < x_1\) and \(b \geq x_3\). However, this means that \(x_2 \in C\). So, we cannot pick out \(\{x_1,x_3\} \) with \(\calC_1\). 

	Since we can pick out one and two element subsets of \(\SR\) with \(\calC_1\), but not arbitrary three element subsets, we get that \(V\left(\calC_1\right)=3\).
\end{example*}


\begin{lemma}[Lemma 2.6.2 VdV\&W]
	\label{lemma:vdv2.6.2}
	Let \(\{x_1,\dots,x_n\}\) be arbitrary points in \(\calX\) and \(\calC\) some collection of subsets of \(\calX\). Then the total number of subsets picked out by \(\calC\), \(\Delta_n(\calC,x_1,\dots,x_n)\) picked out by \(\calC\) is bounded above by the total number of subsets of \(\{x_1,\dots,x_n\}\) shattered by \(\calC\).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Without loss of generality assume that every \(C \in\calC\) is a subset of the given set of points so that \(\Delta_n(\calC,x_1,\dots,x_n)\) is the cardinality of \(\calC\).

	Call the class \(\calC\) \textit{hereditary} if it is closed under subsetting. That is \(C\in\calC\) and \(B \subset C\implies B \in\calC\). Each of the sets in a hereditary collection of sets is shattered\footnote{For any \(B \subset C\), \(B \in\calC\) and \(B \cap C = B\).} so that a hereditary collection shatters at least \(|\calC|\) sets and the assertion of the lemma is certainly true for hereditary collections.\footnote{Taking a look at \eqref{eq:delta-n} we see that all sets picked out by \(\calC\) are all subsets of elements of \(\calC\). Since all subsets of elements of \(\calC\) are also elements of \(\calC\), the number of sets picked out by \(\calC\) is bounded by the number of sets in \(\calC\). Every element of \(\calC\) is clearly shattered by \(\calC\) which gives the statement.} The goal now will be to show that an arbitrary collection \(\calC\) can be transformed into a hereditary collection
	without changing its cardinality or increasing the number of shattered sets.

	Given \(1 \leq i \leq n\) and \(C\in\calC\) define the set
	\[
		T_i(C) 
		= \begin{cases}
		C\setminus\{x_i\}  & \text{if } C\setminus\{x_i\}\notin\calC \\
		C &\text{otherwise }
		\end{cases}
	\]
	The map \(T_i(x)\) is injective (one-to-one) so the collections \(\calC\) and \(T_i(\calC) = \{T_i(C), C \in\calC\} \) have the same cardinalities.\footnote{Recall that \(\Delta_n(\calC,x_1,\dots,x_n) = |\calC|\) since by assumption (without loss of generality) every \(C\in\calC\) is a subset of the given set of points. This holds as well for \(T_i(\calC)\)} Furthermore, every subset \(A\subset \{x_1,\dots,x_n\}\) that is shattered by \(T_i(\calC)\) is shattered by \(\calC\). To see this note that if \(x_i\not\in A\) then \(\{\calC\cap A\} = \{T_i(\calC) \cap A\}\). Conversely if \(x_i\in A\) and \(A\) is shattered by \(T_i(\calC)\) then for every \(B\subset A\) there is a \(C\in\calC\) with \(B \cup \{x_i\} = T_i(C)\cap A\).\footnote{This is just because \(B\cup\{X_i\}\subset A\) and \(A\) is shattered by \(T_i(\calC)\)} This implies that \(x_i\in T_i(C)\) so that \(T_i(C)=C\). This in turns gives that \(C\setminus\{x_i\}\in\calC\) since otherwise \(T_i\) would not have a fixed point at \(C\). Thus both \(B\cup\{x_i\}\) and \(B\setminus\{x_i\} = (C\setminus\{x_i\}) \cap A\) are picked out by \(\calC\). One of these sets equals \(B\).
	
	So the assertion of the lemma is true for \(\calC\) if it is true for \(T_i(\calC)\). Furthermore the assertion of the lemma is true for \(\calC\) if it is true for \(T(\calC)\) where \(T = T_1\circ T_2 \circ \dots\circ T_n\); by repeatedly applying the argument above we have that if a set is shattered by \(T(\calC)\) it is shattered by \(\calC\). Apply \(T\) repeatedly until the collection of sets does not change anymore. This happens after at most \(\sum_{C\in\calC}|C|\) steps (finite) since \(\sum_{C\in\calC} |T_i(C)| < \sum_{C\in\calC} |C|\) whenever the collections \(T_i(\calC)\) and \(\calC\) are different\footnote{We can think of repeatedly applying \(T\) as ``pruning'' the collection \(\calC\), removing elements from sets whose subsets are not contained in \(\calC\).}.  The collection \(\calD\) obtained in this manner has the property that \(D\setminus\{x_i\}\in\calD\) for every
	\(D\in\calD\) and every \(x_i\). So \(\calD\) is hereditary.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[Corollary 2.6.3 VdV\&W]
    \label{corr:vdv2.6.3}
	For a VC-class of sets of index \(V(\calC)\) one has
	\[
		\max_{x_1,\dots,x_n} \Delta_n(\calC,x_1,\dots,x_n) \leq \sum_{j=0}^{V(\calC)-1} \binom{n}{j}
	.\]
	Consequently, the numbers on the left hand side grow polynomially of order at most \(O\left(n^{V(\calC)-1}\right)\) as \(n\to\infty\).
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	The RHS of the corrolary above is the number of subsets of size at most \(V(\calC)-1\). A VC-class shatters no set of \(V(\calC)\) points. All shattered sets are of size at most \(V(\calC)-1\). The number of shattered sets gives an upper bound on \(\Delta_n\) by Lemma~\ref{lemma:vdv2.6.2}. 
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Theorem 2.6.4 VdV\&W]
	\label{thm:vdv2.6.4}
	There exists a universal constant \(K\) such that, for any VC-class \(\calC\) of sets, any probability measure \(Q\), any \(r \geq 1\) and \(0 < \eps < 1\),
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:vdv2.6.4}
		\calN(\eps,\calC,L_r(Q)) \leq KV(\calC)(4e)^{V(\calC)}\left(\frac{1}{\eps} \right)^{r(V(C)-1)}
	\end{equation} 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	The proof of this Theorem takes some 3 pages in VanDerVaart so I am leaving it for now. It can be found on pages 137-139. 
\end{proof}

\begin{remark*}
	For practical purposes, if \(V(\calG) < \infty\), then \(\sup_{Q\in\calQ}\log\calN(\eps,\calG,L_2(Q)) \lesssim \log\left(\frac{1}{\eps}\right)\) which will mean that the \eqref{eq:uniform-entropy-bound} is satisfied. 
\end{remark*}

\begin{example*}
	Suppose \(\calG\) is a VC-class, that is the functions \(\mathds{1}_G\) are measurable for \(G \in \calG\) and \(V(\calG) <\infty\). Since this set of indicator functions is bounded by 1, this class is clearly Donsker. In the example above, we showed that the set \(\calG = \{(a,b]: a< b, a,d \in \SR\}\) has VC-index, \(V(\calG) = 3 < \infty\). By Theorem~\ref{thm:vdv2.6.4} (and subsequently Theorem~\ref{thm:vdv2.5.2}), this is a Donsker class. That is uniformly over \(a,b\in\SR\):
	\[
		\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\sum_{i=1}^n \left\{\mathds{1}[a < X_i \leq b_i] - P(a < X_i < b_i)\right\} \wcov \mathbb{G}
	.\] 
	for some tight element \(\mathbb{G}\) on \(\ell^\infty(\calG)\).
\end{example*}

All together, this is interesting for showing that collections of indicator functions are Donsker, but what about arbitrary classes of functions?

\subsubsection{VC Classes of Functions}

\begin{definition}[Subgraph]
	\label{def:subgraph}
	The subgraph of a function \(f:\calX\to\SR\) is the subset of \(\calX\times\SR\) given by 
	\[
		\left\{(x,t): t< f(x)\right\}
	.\] 
\end{definition}
\begin{remark*}
	Note that the subgraph does not include the points \(\{(x,y): y=f(x)\} \)
\end{remark*}

	\label{fig:subgraph}
\end{figure}
\begin{definition}[VC Class for Functions]
	\label{def:vc-function-class}
	A collection of functions \(\calF\) is called a VC-subgraph class, or just a VC-class if the collections of all subgraphs of the functions in \(\calF\) forms a VC-class of sets in \(\calX\times\SR\). Let \(V(\calF)\) be the VC-index of the set of subgraphs of functions in \(\calF\).	
\end{definition}

Just as for sets, the covering numbers of VC-classes of functions grow at a polynomial rate. 

\begin{theorem}[Theorem 2.6.7 VdV\&W]
	\label{thm:vdv2.6.7}
	Let \(\calF\) be a VC-class of functions with measurable envelope \(F\). Then for \(r\geq 1\) and any probability measure \(Q\) with \(\|F\|_{Q,r} > 0\),
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:vc-function-covering}
		\calN\left(\eps\|F\|_{Q,r},\calF,L_r(Q)\right) \leq KV(\calF)\left(16e\right)^{V(\calF)}\left(\frac{1}{\eps}\right)^{r(V(\calF)-1)}
	\end{equation}
	for a universal constant \(K\) and \(0 < \eps < 1\).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let \(\calC\) be the set of all subgraphs \(C_f\) of functions \(F\in\calF\). That is
	\begin{align*}
		C_f &= \left\{(x,t): t < f(x)\right\} \\
		\calC &= \left\{C_f: f\in\calF\right\}
	\end{align*}
	By Fubini's Theorem, \(Q|f-g| = \left(Q\times\lambda\right)\left(C_f\triangle C_g\right)\) where \(A\triangle B = (A\setminus B)\cup(B\setminus A) = (A\cup B) \setminus (A\cap B)\) is the symmetric difference of two sets.\footnote{It is useful to recall that 
	\begin{align*}
		C_f \cup C_g &= \left\{(x,t): t < f(x)\text{ or }t < g(x)\right\} \\
		C_f \cap C_g &= \left\{(x,t): t < f(x)\text{ and }t< g(x)\right\}
	\end{align*}
	and also that \(Q\) is a probability measure over \(\calX\) whereas \(\lambda\) is a measure over \(\SR\). Both \(C_f\) and \(C_g\) are subsets of \(\calX\times\SR\).}
	\begin{figure}[htpb]

		\begin{tikzpicture}
			\draw (0,0)--(0,0) node[anchor = north east]{\(\calO\)};

		\end{tikzpicture}
		\caption{The symmetric difference \(C_f\triangle C_g\) is shaded in yellow}%
		\label{fig:symmetric-diff}	
	\end{figure}
	Renormalize \(Q\times\lambda\) to a probability measure on the set \(\{(x,t): |t|\leq F(x)\}\) by defining \(P = \frac{(Q\times\lambda)}{2QF}\). Then, by the result in Theorem~\ref{thm:vdv2.6.4} we have that
	\[
		\calN\left(\eps(2QF), \calF, L_1(Q)\right) = \calN\left(\eps,\calC,L_1(P)\right) \leq  KV(\calF)\left(\frac{4e}{\eps}\right)^{V(\calF)-1}
	.\]
	By adjusting the constant \(K\) to convert \((4e)^{V(\calF)-1}\) to a \((16e)^{V(\calF)}\) this concludes the proof for \(r=1\).

	For \(r > 1\) note that \(2F\) is an envelope for \(\calF_\infty\), a property that we have used before. Define \(R\) to be the probability measure with density \(F^{r-1}/QF^{r-1} \) with respect to \(Q\). That is \(R\bar f = Q\left(\bar f\frac{F^{r-1}}{QF^{r-1}}\right)\) for any function \(\bar f:\calX\to\SR\). Then:
	\[
		Q|f-g|^r \leq  Q|f-g|(2F)^{r-1} = 2^{r-1}R|f-g|QF^{r-1} 
	.\]
	Thus the \(L_r(Q)\) distance is bounded by the distance \(2(QF^{r-1})^{1/r}\|f-g\|_{R,1}^{1/r}\). This gives that 
	\[
		\calN\left(\eps 2\|F\|_{Q,r},\calF,L_r(Q)\right) \leq \calN\left(\eps^r \|F\|_{R,1},\calF,L_1(R)\right)
	.\] 
	which can be uniformly bounded by the result for \(r=1\). This gives the result after nothing that \(\frac{1}{\eps^r} = \left(\frac{1}{\eps}\right)^r\).
\end{proof}
If the conditions of Theorem~\ref{thm:vdv2.6.7} are satisfied with \(V(\calF) < \infty\) then we can bound the \eqref{eq:uniform-entropy-bound} with
\begin{align*}
	\int_{0}^{\infty} \sup_{Q\in\calQ} \sqrt{\log\calN\left(\eps\|F\|_{Q,2},\calF,L_2(Q)\right)}\;d\eps 
	&\lesssim \int_{0}^{1} \sqrt{\log\calN\left(\eps\|F\|_{Q,2},\calF,L_1(Q)\right)}\;d\eps \\  
	&\lesssim \int_{0}^{1} \sqrt{\log \tilde K \left(\frac{1}{\eps}\right)^{2(V(\calF)-1)}}\;d\eps < \infty 
\end{align*}
where the first step is using the fact that if \(\eps > 1\) we only need one ball of radius \(\eps\|F\|_{Q,2}\) to cover \(\calF\) under \(Q\)  and then noting that the covering numbers under \(L_1\) differ from the covering numbers under \(L_2\) by a bounded constant.

\begin{example*}
	Suppose \(\calF = \left\{\sum_{j=1}^K \beta_j\phi_j(x), \left(\beta_1,\dots,\beta_K\right)\in\SR^K\right\}\). Then \(V(\calF) \leq K+2\). How? Recall that we are considering the VC-index of the collection
	\[
	\calC = \left\{\left\{(x,t): t \leq \beta'\phi(x)\right\}: \beta\in\SR^K\right\} \subseteq 2^{\calX\times\SR} 
	.\]
	Pick \((x_1,t_1),\dots,(x_{k+2},t_{k+2})\) distinct points in \(\calX\times\SR\). Then for any \(f\in\calF\):
	\[
		\begin{bmatrix} f\left(x_1\right) \\ \vdots \\ f\left(x_{n+2}\right) \end{bmatrix}  = 
		\beta_1 \begin{bmatrix} \phi_1\left(x_1\right) \\ \vdots \\ \phi_1\left(x_{n+2}\right) \end{bmatrix} + \dots + 
		\beta_K \begin{bmatrix} \phi_K\left(x_1\right) \\ \vdots \\ \phi_K\left(x_{n+2}\right) \end{bmatrix} 
	.\]
	so \(\left(f(x_1),\dots,f(x_K)\right)\) is in a subspace of \(\SR^{K+2}\) of dimension \(K\) for any \(f\in\calF\). Similarly, we can show that \(f(x) - t\) is in a subspace of dimension \(K+1\) for any fixed \(f\in\calF\) and \(t_1,\dots,t_{K+2}\).

	To show that \(V(\calF) \leq K+2\) we want to show that \(\left\{\left(x_1,t_1\right),\dots,\left(x_{K+2},t_{K+2}\right)\right\}\) cannot be shattered by subgraphs of \(\calF\). That is we want a subset \(A\subseteq \left\{\left(x_1,t_1\right),\dots,(x_{K+2},t_{K+2}\right\}\) such that \(\not\exists f \in \calF\) with
	\[
		A = \left\{\left(x_1,t_1\right),\dots,(x_{K+2},t_{K+2})\right\} \cap \left\{(x,t):t<f(x)\right\} 
	.\]
	Since for any fixed \(f\in\calF, t_1,\dots,t_{K+2}\), \(f(x_1)-t_1,\dots,f(x_{K+2})-t_{K+2})\) is in a subspace of dimension \(K+1\) of \(\SR^{K+2}\) for any \(x_1,\dots,x_{K+2}\), there exists a vector \(a\neq 0\) orthogonal to this subspace such that
	\[
		\sum_{j=1}^{K+2} a_j(f(x_j)-t_j) = 0 \implies \sum_{a_j > 0} a_j\left(f(x_j)-t_j\right) = \sum_{a_j \leq 0} (-a_j)(f(x_j)-t_j)
	.\]
	Pick the indices corresponding to the positive \(a_j > 0\) values (the indices on the LHS after the implication) and consider \(A = \{(x_j,t_j):a_j>0\}\). Since \(a\neq 0\) we know this set is non-empty. If \(A =\{(x_1,t_1),\dots,(x_{K+2},t_{K+@})\}  \cap \{(x,t):t<f(x)\}\) for some \(f\in\calF\) then
	\[
		\sum_{a_j > 0} a_i(f(x_j) - t_j) > 0 \geq \sum_{a_j\leq 0} (-a_j)(f(x_j)-t_j)
	.\] 
	which is a contradiction as these two are equal as demonstrated above. Thus \(V(\calF)\leq K+2\). However, notice that unless the functions \(\phi_j(x)\) are all uniformly equal to 0, the class \(\calF\) does not have an envelope with \(P^\star F <\infty\), so it is neither Glivenko-Cantelli nor Donsker unless we restrict the parameter space (the range of \(\beta_1,\dots,\beta_K\)). It is useful to consider the following sanity check: 
	\[
		\sup_{\beta_1,\dots,\beta_K} \left|\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\left(\beta_1\phi_1(x_i) + \dots+\beta_k\phi_K(x_i)\right) - \E[\dots]  \right| = \infty
	.\]  
	This example can be generalized and outlines the proof for the next lemma
\end{example*}
\begin{lemma}[VC Dimension of Finite Dimensional Vector Spaces]
	\label{lemma:vdv2.6.15}
	Any finite dimensional vector space \(\calF\) of measurable functions \(f:\calX\to\SR\) is a VC function class with \(V(\calF)\leq \text{dim}(\calF)+2\).	
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Follows the example above. Can also be found as Lemma 2.6.16 in VanDerVaart and Wellner.
\end{proof}
Another examples of a VC function class is given below:
\begin{lemma}[VC Dimension of Translates]
	\label{lemma:vdv2.6.16}
	Let \(\psi:\SR\to\SR\) be a monotonic function and let \(\calF\) be the set of all translates of \(\psi\), \(\calF = \left\{\psi(x-h):h\in\SR\right\}\). Then \(V(\calF)=2\).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	This follows similarly from the example above where we considered the VC-dimension of \(\calC = \left\{(-\infty,b):a<b\right\}\). Without loss of generality suppose that \(\psi\) is decreasing and denote \(\psi_h = \psi(x-h)\). The subgraphs of \(\psi_h\) are nested in that if \(h > h'\), \(C_{h'} \subseteq C_{h}\) since if \(t < \psi_{h'}(x)\) then \(t < \psi_h(x)\). Take any two element subset of \(\SR\times\SR\): \(\{(x_1,t_1),(x_2,t_2)\}\). By considering the single element subsets of this set we see that we cannot shatter this set without breaking the nesting of the subgraphs so \(V(\calF)=2\). 
\end{proof}
