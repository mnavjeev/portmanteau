These are my notes on empirical process theory. Compiled during a reading group in Winter/Spring 2021 that Andres was kind enough to lead. The main latex file is wcep.tex, subfiles are in the "Week x" folders. If you want to compile it on your own you should make sure that the manu_long.sty file is in the same directory. The .tex file should compile without warnings, but if one is found let me know. 

So far outline is as follows:

**COVERED**.  
Math Review:  
   -- Vector Spaces and Norms.    
   -- Topology and Continuity.    
   -- Probability Spaces and Outer Measure.    
Weak Convergence:    
   -- Definition and Characterizations.    
   -- Weak Convergence in the Space of Bounded Functions.     
Empirical Processes:   
   -- Maximal Inequalities.  
   -- Symmetrization.  
   -- Glivenko-Cantelli Theorems.  
   -- Donsker Theorems.  

**TO BE COVERED**.
